# zmes-telegram
a script for telegram notifications using zmes (zoneminder and eventnotification)

i just used the already made script pushapi_pushover.py and made the necessary changes to work with telegram bot.

The chat_id variable is not getting the values from secrets.ini for some reason so you would have to fill that value on pushapi_telegram.py itself.

You will need to install the module python-telegram-bot for the script to work.
